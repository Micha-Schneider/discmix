# DiscMix
R package for fitting discrete finite mixture models (such as CUB, CUP, BetaBin and cure models). The package is constantly updated and extended. It can perform unpenalized model estimation (discmix()), variable selection via penalization (penmix()) and forward selection (stepmix()), and bootstrap samples for standard errors (se.discmix()). 

Note: For using the full functionality please install first the current MRSP version from https://github.com/WolfgangPoessnecker/MRSP and then DiscMix (https://github.com/Micha-Schneider/discmix).
